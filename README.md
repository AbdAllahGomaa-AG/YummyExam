Yummy! This project is designed to bring the world of delicious food recipes right to your screen. Here are some of the standout featuresüç≤‚ú®

- Home Page: Showcasing random recipes. Click on any card to dive into the full recipe details and source.

- Search Page: Find meals by name or first letter. If a meal isn't found, you'll receive a notification that it doesn't exist.

This project leverages everything I've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, along with the power of Bootstrap for responsive design. It includes eye-catching animations and a handy aside bar for seamless navigation. I utilized regex for form validation to ensure data accuracy. Each page dynamically fetches data from APIs and includes a loading state for a smooth user experience. Plus, the entire site is fully responsive, ensuring a great experience on any device.
